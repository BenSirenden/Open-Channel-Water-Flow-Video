<b> Actual Rotation Data Set </b>
<p align="justify">
All videos in this folder were taken using a cellphone camera from a distance of about less than 1 meters, with the camera parallel to
the water surface. The video was shot  on the surface of a small river located on Tanah Baru Raya, Depok, Indonesia. This river streams down its water from Bogor to  Jakarta.  This location was chosen for reasons of ease of access and security. Videos were shot at various dates in November and December 2019. These months are chosen because November and Desember is rainy season in Bogor and Jakarta,  so  the  river  where  video is taken still have water running through it. The folder name is the date when the video was taken.
For each dates, the camera rotated at 4 different angles, except for <b>26-11-2019</b> and <b> 05-12-2019 </b>. The image below illustrates the camera rotate angle <b>(&alpha;)</b>.

<p>
 The <b>&alpha;</b> values for the video shoots dated <b>05-11-2019</b>, <b>19-11-2019</b> and <b>21-11-2019</b> are shown in the table below.
</p>
 
 
| Video Index | &alpha; |
|:-:|:-:|
| First Video | <p align="center"> 0<sup>o</sup> </p> |
| Second Video | <p align="center"> 0<sup>o</sup> <&alpha;<90<sup>o</sup> </p> |
| Third Video | <p align="center">270<sup>o</sup> <&alpha;<360<sup>o</sup></p> |
| Fourth Video | <p align="center">90<sup>o</sup></p> |

Unlike before, in the subfolder <b>26-11-2019</b>, four video data have the same <b>&alpha;</b> which is 90<sup>o</sup>. So the four videos have simmilar flow rate and direction. In subfolder <b>28-11-2019</b>, the angle of the video frame was rotated clockwise from <b>α</b> = 0<sup>o</sup>, to 0<sup>o</sup><<b>α</b><90<sup>o</sup>,and then <b>α</b>= 90<sup>o</sup> in the same video capture. Data retrieval  was  done  4  times and there was no pause during data gatherings. The <b>duration</b> of each video that has been discussed above is about <b>10 seconds</b>. Subfolder 12-05-2019 has only two video data, less than the other subfolders. Just like the subfolder 28-11-2019, in this subfolder the camera is rotated during the shooting process, the difference is the number of & alpha is more, the duration is longer, which is 24 seconds, and the shooting is paused before the camera is rotated. The table below shows the α values used.
