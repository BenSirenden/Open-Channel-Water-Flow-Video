<b> Actual Rotation Data Set </b>
<p align="justify">
All videos in this folder were taken using a cellphone camera from a distance of about less than 1 meters, with the camera parallel to
the water surface. The video was shot  on the surface of a small river located on Tanah Baru Raya, Depok,Indonesia . This river streams down its water from Bogor to  Jakarta.  This location was chosen for reasons of ease of access and security. Videos were shot at various dates in November and December 2019. These months are chosen because November and Desember is rainy season in Bogor and Jakarta,  so  the  river  where  video is taken still have water running through it. The folder name is the date when the video was taken.
