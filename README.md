# Open-Channel-Water-Flow-Video
<p align="justify">
The videos in this respitory are collected as data in research on the appropriate image processing algorithm to determine the velocity of surface water flow in open channels. The videos are divided into two folders. The first folder is a collection of videos that will be rotated virtually to test the algorithm. The second folder is a video that is not rotated virtually, but the camera that takes the picture is actually rotated. Only one sub folder that contains a collection of videos that are not experiencing the actual rotation. 
The videos in the sub-folder are used to test the reproducibility of the computational results of the algorithm. Description of the location and date of the video was taken in the readme.md file in each folder.
